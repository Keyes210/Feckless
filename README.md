# Feckless
ORIGINAL, complete. An app to keep track of the time you're wasting.


This is a stopwatch app meant to keep track of idle time, time that you could have used more productively. The stopwatch will persist whether the app is paused, or stopped, or killed. User’s can save a given time for a day of the week via a Floating Action Button that expands into a toolbar. From the Navigation Drawer, users can get to a tabbed layout that contains saved times for each day. There is also a screen with a tally of the whole week, and from there users can clear all of the week’s data. I used <a href="https://github.com/fafaldo/FABToolbar">FABToolbar</a> for my morphing FAB.
